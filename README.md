# HyprWM Nix Repo

Attempt at gathering all derivations in one place, just like Nixpkgs, but for the Hypr Ecosystem.

## TODO

- check how we can scale
- check how to update npins on push (webhooks?)
- check how to retrieve date of commit
- check how to provide proper CI to respective repos
- devshells?

I have a strong feeling this will be a failure. Regardless, I'll experiment.
